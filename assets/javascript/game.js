// thoughts as Im researching:  in Jquery, can we select all 4 at once
// (cat, swan, horse, koala) that will allow 
//random value to be assigned to each individual one of them at the same time (within function)v

var score = 0
//get random number 
score = Math.floor(Math.random() * 102) + 19;
console.log(score);


//for each crystal
